# multigame
I am writing my multiplayer game in C++ using the SFML graphics library.

I am developing my own engine specifically for this game, but it can be imported for other games

# Attention

The game may not run on your computer due to the lack of some extensions (.dll). If this happens, then copy all the extensions from the "bin" folder to the game folder.

If you want to recompile the game, then use the Makefile. Don't forget to include the library!
