We are the "Boys At Github" team. We create our own game in C++ using the SFML library.

We developing our own engine specifically for this game, but part of engine can be used for other projects

You can suggest various features in VK messages: https://vk.com/majong562

At the moment the game is not playable. We are at the development stage of the engine. In the future, game mechanics and a plot that are already being written will be added. The game is conceived in the roguelike style. Our team has artists, so all the sprites for the game will be their own.
