# multigame
I am writing my multiplayer game in C++ using the SFML graphics library.

I am developing my own engine specifically for this game, but it can be imported for other games

# Attention
All programs located in folders may not run on your computer due to the lack of some extensions (.dll). If this happens, then add all the extensions from the "bin" folder to the program folder. In some works, a third-party SFML library is used. If you want to recompile sources, then include the appropriate library, which is located in the "src" folder.
